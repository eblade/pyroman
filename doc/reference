= Syntax =

The PyRoman syntax is rather lightly defined in its very basics. The idea is to
extense it modularily with the help of syntax sugar when appropriate. Since the
structure of a document here is considered to be a flow of elements, a PyRoman
document is easiest represented as a flow of objects, each representing either
a visible object or some helper entitity such as setup or translation. An
object is represented by the following syntax:

Code: 
caption: The general object
-
Object: primary value
argument1: value1
argument2: value2
...
argumentN: valueN
multiline content
goes here
this can be anything
[empty line]

This is about it for syntax. A document consists of a sequence of objects like
this. There however two little tweaks for comfort and ful functionality:

List:
* If the document starts with some words on a line, it is assumed to be a Title
  objects. The second line, if not a properly formatted argument, is assumed to
  be a subtitle.
* If any content should start with a word plus colon, arguments and content
  must be separated by a single dash on a line.
* Contents which naturally contains empty line must have spaces on them not to
  terminate the object.

Code: text
caption: Example document which demonstrates the tweaks.
This is the document title
This is the document subtitle
author: The Author
 
Code:
caption: My best urls in a Code object

= Object Reference =

These are the standard objects in PyRoman. Syntax parts in [brackets] are
optional, the brackets are not part of the code.

== Break ==

A simple page break. Use this if you want to control object flow for printing.

Code: text
caption: Syntax for Break
-
Break:

== Code ==

The Code object provides syntax-higlighted code with a caption.

Code: text
caption: Syntax for Code
-
Code: [language]
[caption: Your caption goes here]
[linenumbers: yes/no]
Your code goes here.

Remember to replace empty lines with ones that has a space or a tab on them at
least, otherwise the object will en prematurely.

== Comment ==

Comment:
This is a comment.

A Comment object is like in other languages intended mainly for the author,
however, they can be used to highlight things in a draft. The <b>state</b> of
the document controls whether they are t be shown in the rendering or not.

To control the state, use:

Code:
-
Set:
state: draft/final

where <b>draft</b> has the comments visible, and <b>final</b> does not.

Code: text
caption: Syntax for Comment
-
Comment:
[type: crit]
Comment text goes here and can
span several line, for it is content.

The type here only controls what template to be used, there is now normal
(leave empty) and crit, which prints a more warning-like comment box.

== Dot ==

This is not yet implemented but will feature support to write DOT code
which will be rendered and represented graphically in the document.

This object will transform into a Figure object.

== Figure ==

The Figure object displays a picture with a caption and labeling with
numbering for cross-referencing purposes.

There is still much left to do regarding formatting, it now only supports
full-width figures.

Code: text
caption: Syntax for Figure
-
Figure:
file: myfile.png

Comment:
The urlencodings should be stored in css so they can be used several times
throughout a document. For example, bullet points and such will benefit from
this.

The picture data is read and encoded with base64. For HTML output that data is
later wrapped as urlencoding by the template.

Figures use the counter <i>figure</i> and the table <i>TOF</i>.

== Generic ==

The generic object is not really a fully qualified object. All objects are 
generic when they are first parsed. The second round they get transformed to
the objects they were intended to be.

Code: text
caption: Generic arguments:
-
substitute: yes/no (defaults to yes)
            controls whether the processor should substitute beyond the initial
            template substitution.


== Heading ==

Headings are rather self-explanatory in their use but not necessarily in their
use. Firstly, there are seven levels of headings and subheadings, representing
their underlying section hierarchy. Numbering is of course done automatically
and hierarchically.

Code: text
caption: Syntax for Heading
-
Heading: The Actual Heading
[level: 1-7 (default 2)]

If you think this is to extensive and cumbersome for something as frequently
used as headings, fear not, since Headings make use of the build in regex-based
syntax sugar engine. Below is a complete list of ways you can express a heading:

Code: text
caption: Heading Syntax Sugar
= First Level Heading =
== Second Level Heading ==
=== Third Level Heading ===
==== Fourth Level Heading ====
===== Fifth Level Heading =====
======= Sixth Level Heading ======
======== Seventh Level Heading ========
or
h1. First Level Heading
h2. Second Level Heading
h3. Third Level Heading
h4. Fourth Level Heading
h5. Fifth Level Heading
h6. Sixth Level Heading
h7. Seventh Level Heading

There are ideas to add NoML-style headings as well.

Headings use the counters <i>toc1</i>-<i>toc7</i> and the table <i>TOC</i>.

== HtmlWrapper ==

The HtmlWrapper wraps the document in html using HTML for publishing using
the templates for each object. The templates used have their <i>output</i>
argument set to <b>html</b>. The object also provides the canvas HTML for the
report. Wrappers are via their code recognized as wrappers and do not need much
attention at all.

Code:

== Inline ==

<i>Not yet supported.</i>

The idea is that this object shall provide a set of syntax sugars intended for
inline use, that also have the ability to create objects to use with this.

== Input ==

This object does basically the same as the LaTeX command with the same name, it
directly includes the contents of another file. The difference is that in
PyRoman, it is used as the main tool for using libraries, as the template files
are included with this. You shouldn't have to worry about using it that way
unless you build your own objects.

However it can easily be used for fractioning your document into smaller parts.

Code: text
caption: Syntax for Input
-
Input: path/to/file

Worth noting is that the path is relative to one of the following paths (in
prioritized order):

List:
* working directory
* 'conf' folder in working directory
* the global template directory, usually .pyroman/templates

If none of these are found, PyRoman will cast an error, but as usual, this is
not the end of the world. PyRoman tells you about errors, but will stop at
(almost) nothing.

== Link ==

The link object has limited use before inlining is satisfactorily implemented
but can still be used to produce an HTML link with a caption. I will be 
represented as its own paragraph.

Code: text
caption: Syntax for Link
-
Link: url
[title: Clear-text title] (defaults to url)

The idea is to develop this to handle inline objects and cross-references. That
should be a piece of cake, but now I'm writing this manual instead...

== List ==

PyRoman supports lists in a nested fashion, but so far, the formatting options
are rather limited. Two bullet types exist:

List:
* Dash (-)
* Dots (...)

You can choose them with the <i>style</i> argument, which is then '-' or '...'.
If you pick anything else it will still be a dash.

Code: text
caption: Syntax for List
-
List: [style]
[caption: The Example List]
* First level bullet
** Second level bullet
   text can wrap around
* Back to first level
* It
** Supports
*** Four
**** Levels

List:
caption: The Example List
* First level bullet
** Second level bullet
   text can wrapp around
* Back to first level
* It
** Supports
*** Four
**** Levels

It don't know why I chose four, but I guess I didn't want to make more
templates than that.

== NormailzeCss ==

The NormailzeCss object uses a copy of the normalize.css available at:

Link: http://link/to/normalize.css

It adds its contents to the style of the document to make it more
cross-platform.

Code:
caption: Syntax for NormalizeCss
-
NormalizeCss:

== Paragraph ==

A paragraph is the most basic element in a document. Therefore, this is
considered to be the default object. If there is no object notation, the
processor will assume it is a paragraph, very much like the TeX processor does.

However, if you would like to do anything special like setting an argument for
the Paragraph object, you will have to use the standard notation. At the moment
there are no such arguments but then again if you add them yourself, here is
the syntax:

Code: text
caption: Syntax for Paragraph
-
Paragraph:
Here comes the text.
 
 or simply:
 
Here comes the text.

== Publish ==

If you want the processor to automatically push the result up to a server, you
can use the Publish object. It currently supports scp but can be extended with
more protocols.

Code: text
caption: Syntax for Publish
-
Publish: [protocol] (default is scp)
uri: username@server:/path/to/target/file

I have not tested this without keys, but its not really good without them
anyway,

== Set ==

The Set object is simple way to set global variables, which are as their name
suggests variables accessible from everywhere. In templates you can use the

Code: text
substitute: no
-
%variable% 

syntax to get a value. They are of course recursive, so you can have the
variable notation inside of a variable value and it will in turn be replaced.

The Set object can handle multiple variable settings, and it works like this:

Code: text
caption: Syntax for Set
-
Set: [no-overwrite] (or leave empty)
variable1: value1
variable2: value2
...
variableN: valueN

The no-overwrite option only assigns the variable if it isn't already set.

== Template ==

Templates are the heart of the visual representation of the object flow. For
HTML, which is the first and only output mode, they represent HTML code, CSS
styles and JavaScript code. Templates are populated and used in the flow order,
except for Wrapper templates which are used last (and there can only be one).

Code: text
caption: Syntax for Template
-
Template: [Template Name]
output: html (currently, but pdf or latex would be cool)
place: body|style|script|...
Here comes the template
which can span
multiple lines.

So, for the HTML output you typically specify two templates, one for the body
and one for styles. Those are separated so the styles only get injected ones
by the wrapper.

Templates use a domain-specific language, which is at the moment rather crude.

Code: text
caption: Syntax inside Templates
substitute: no
-
Variable:      %variable%
List:          %$list using Template%
Counter:       !!counter!!
Translation:   __translation__
Link:          [[target Title]]
Inline object: %Object[primary;argument1:value1;argument2:value2]:contents%

Each of those deserve a fair bit of explanation:

=== Variable ===

A variable is just a piece of text with a name used for dynamic content.
Variable are stored in hash tree, which of there are several. Firstly, there is
a global one called globalvars, then there is a local one called localvars, and
last there is another local one called arguments, which holds the arguments
specified to the object. They are searched in the reverse order from the one
given here as soon as encountering a variable in the above format. The process
is done in a recursive manner, so if a variable is substituted in a string, it
will be processed again and again until no substitution is done. This of course
means that you can make endless loops. Don't.

=== List ===

Lists are like variables but with two exceptions:

List:
* They always start with a dollar ($) sign
* They contain a list of hash tables

So, what's a list of hash tables? Well, really it's a suitable combination of
python structures. Lists are intended for templates of elements that repeats
themselves a non-fixed number of times. What you do is to specify two templates,
one for the main element and one for a model of a sub-element. Then you can
use the above <i>$list using SubElementTemplate</i> structure for the elements.
You will have to use a python Plugin to create the actual repetative object.

=== Counter ===

The counter notation is basically a shortcut to variables in the $Counters
system variable list in globalvars. You might as well write:

Code: text
substitute: no
%$Counters.counter%

instead of

Code:
substitute: no
!!counter!!

And yes, you use dot (.) as a path separator in variable names. It's really a
hash tree, remember.

=== Translation ===

Translations are also shortcuts, shortcuts to:

Code: text
substitute: no
%$i18n.[language].token%

The [language] here is really the global variable language which can be set
using Set. You can then easily use the Translate object to create dictionaries
for internationalization.

=== Link ===

Links are a bit wiki-like. They take one or two arguments, a target, and a
Title. The latter one is optional and will be filled in automatically.

==== Internal links ====

Internal links are prefixed with a #. You will need to define a label on your
object. 

Code:
= This is a heading =
label: this
 
Visit this link: [[#this]]

The title of this link will automatically be the title of the heading.

==== External links ====

External links are not prefixed with anything, just use the adress, relative
or absolute as the target.

Code:
Visit this link [[http://www.google.com Google]].

=== Inline Object ===

Inline objects is still not implemented, but the intended use is for inline
formatting and insertion of graphical objects like pictures and equations in
text. The syntax suggested here is rather complicated but never really
intended for use. Instead, it is recommended to define Syntax Sugars for
specific objects that supports inlining.

== Title ==

The title object is pretty much an imitation of the LaTeX command \title. It
prints a title object with title, subtitle, author and date, variables which can
all be manually set using Set:

Code: text
caption: Changing th title variables
-
Set:
title: The Title
subtitle: The Subtitle
author: The Author
date: the/current/date
 
or
 
Title: The Title
[subtitle: The Subtitle]
[author: The Author]
[date: the/current/date]
 
or as the first lines of the page
 
The Title
[The Subtitle]
[author: The Author]
[date: the/current/date]

Date will default to today's date. It's a nice idea to let some startup file
in .pyroman/templates set the author automatically. You can put this in the
common file for example.

== TOC ==

The TOC object inserts a Table of Contents, or actually a table of anything
correctly shaped. It supports linking and leveling, and at the moment Headings
and Figures are supported.

== Translate ==

== Use ==
